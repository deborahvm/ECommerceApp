ECommerceApp
============

[E-commerce][] application modeling for analysis and simulation in cloud computing. A good way to evaluate your management policy in a controlled environment. Besides, this model allows the production of tracelogs, scarce in cloud environments because of business and confidentiality. This project uses [CloudSim][] framework and [R][] software via [REngine][] library.

Features
--------

* The models can be used to support your own resource management strategy
* All statistical make decisions could be developet through R statistical language
* A resource prediction model based on Elman ANN  is provided 


Dependencies and Configuration Issues
-------------------------------------

ECommerceApp depends on:  
  1. [CloudSim][CloudSim2], a framework that enables simulation of cloud computing infrastructures;
  2. [DVFS package][DVFS], it is a CloudSim package which allows Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scale (DVFS) simulation to support energy-eficiency resource management policies;
  3. [R][], it is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics; 
  4. [JRI][], it is a Java/R Interface which allows to run R inside Java applications.

You can find instructions for project configuration on the ECommerceApp wiki. ECommerceApp requires CloudSim version 3.0.3.

Example
-------

The usefulness of models is demonstrated through a use case on CPU utilization forecasting.
