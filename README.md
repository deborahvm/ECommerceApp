ECommerceApp
============

[E-commerce][] application modeling for analysis and simulation in cloud computing. It presents a resource prediction model to support the development of resource management policies. Thus, it is a good way to evaluate your management policy in a controlled environment. Besides, this model allows the production of tracelogs, scarce in cloud environments because of business and confidentiality. This project uses [CloudSim][] framework and [R][] software via [REngine][].
